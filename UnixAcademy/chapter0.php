    <h2>What is Unix?</h2>
    <p>Unix is the meat of a computer's software, without it, our computer is worthless. 
    In short, Unix is a collection of operating systems that brings substance to our computer. 
    Different types of operating systems include:
        <ul>
            <li>Windows</li>
            <li>macOS</li>
            <li>Linux</li>
            <li>Chrome OS</li>
            <li>Android</li>
            <li>iOS</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Who Created Unix?</h3>
    <p>
        In 1969, Unix was developed at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas Mcilroy, 
        Joseph Ossanna. Originally collaborating with researchers from MIT and General Electrics on an
        operating system named Multics, the godfathers of Unix dropped out of the 
        project due to its complexity and developed a simpler version. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As the popularity of Unix increased, companies began emulating Unix and making their own Unix-like 
        operating systems. Most likely, the operating system you're using now is based on Linux.
    </p>
    <h3>The Command Line Interface/Terminal</h3>
    <p>
        The main importance of UNIX is the use of UNIX commands that we can use to navigate our way around our computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Command prompts are used by many operating systems that serve as the home for writing UNIX commands on our computer. 
        The command prompt is often called a “terminal” or “command line interface” (CLI).
    </p>
    <p>In Chapter 1, we will overview some basic commands available for use in the command prompt.</p>
